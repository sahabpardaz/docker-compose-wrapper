/**
 * This package contains machinery to start external dependencies of your tests such as databases, hadoop, .. as docker
 * containers. You must describe these services as a set of docker-compose files and add {@link
 * ir.sahab.dockercomposer.DockerCompose} as a rule to your test. This rule will bring those services up before your
 * test and you can access them by their ips and published ports.
